## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [font-awesome-cdn](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome) - Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit.

### What I learned

This basic project helped me to practice CSS Flexbox and Responsive Design techniques

Learned how to make a footer fixed at bottom of th page

```css
footer {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

Will continue to explore Responsive design is greater depth and try to implement a design using mobile first approach
